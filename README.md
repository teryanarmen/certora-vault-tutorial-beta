# Certora Vault Example Tutorial

This tutorial builds a simple Tokenized Vault, inspired by the  [ERC-4626
TOKENIZED VAULT STANDARD](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) on Ethereum.

## Installation
1. First, visit [Certora.com](https://www.certora.com) and sign up for a free account [here](https://www.certora.com/signup).
2. You will receive an email with a temporary password and a personal access key. Use the password to login to Certora following the link in the email.
3. During the workshop, we recommend following along by using Github Codespaces that you can launch from this repository.
4. Once your codespace has launched, you should have a web-based editor that looks like VSCode.
5. From the terminal of this editor, use the personal access key (from Step 2) to set a temporary environment variable like so `export CERTORAKEY=<personal_access_key>`.

## Code structure

The main logic of the vault is organized as follows. 

- The `Vault` is defined in `programs/vault/src/state.rs`

- Core vault operations are located in `programs/vault/src/operations`
 
  These operations implement the vault's asset and shares logic
  (independent of Solana runtime):

1. `vault_deposit_assets(tokens_amount)`
2. `vault_redeem_shares(shares_amout)`
3. `vault_update_reward(new_amount)`
4. `vault_process_slash(slash_amount)`

Additional functions that support fees:

- `vault_deposit_assets_with_fee(tokens_amount)`
- `vault_collect_fee`


Vault functions that operates on Solana `AccountInfo` are
implemented in `programs/vault/src/processor`:

1. `process_deposit(accounts, tokens_amount)`
2. `process_redeem_shares(accounts, shares_amount)`
3. `process_update_reward(accounts, new_amount)`
4. `process_slash(accounts, slash_amount)`

Fee-based processor functions are also provided.

## Specifications

All formal specifications are located in
`programs/vault/src/certora/specs`.

Notation:

- Vault assets: $\text{assets}$

- Vault shares: $\text{shares}$

- Tokens held in the SPL account: $\text{token}_{\text{amount}}$

- Total minted supply of SPL tokens: $\text{mint}_{\text{supply}}$

- fee in basis points (max = `10_000`): $\text{fee}_{\text{bps}}$
 
- fee deducted from a given operation: $\text{fee}$


### Simple properties 

Assets should not decrease:

```math
\text{assets}_{\text{post}}  \geq \text{assets}_{\text{pre}}
```


Shares should not decrease:

```math
\text{shares}_{\text{post}}  \geq \text{shares}_{\text{pre}}
```

Monotonicity of assets and shares 

```math
\text{assets}_{\text{pre}} \leq \text{assets}_{\text{post}} \implies \text{shares}_{\text{pre}}  \leq \text{shares}_{\text{post}}
```

### Vault consistency

The vault must remain consistent with the underlying SPL accounts:

```math
\text{assets} \leq \text{token}_{\text{amount}} \wedge \text{shares} = \text{mint}_{\text{supply}}
```

### No dilution 

To maintain proportional ownership (except during slashing
operations), the vault must ensure:


```math
 \frac{\text{assets}_{\text{pre}}}{\text{shares}_{\text{pre}}} \leq \frac{\text{assets}_{\text{post}}}{\text{shares}_{\text{post}}}
```

This guarantees that the asset-to-share ratio does not decrease after
any operation.

### Solvency

The vault needs to ensure the following invariant to remain solvent:


```math
\text{shares} \leq \text{assets}
```


### Fees

If a fee rate is configured, then a corresponding fee must be
deducted:

```math
\text{fee}_{\text{bps}} > 0 \implies \text{fee} > 0 
```


### Inflation attack
